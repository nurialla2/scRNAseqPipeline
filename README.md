# scRNAseqPipeline

The following code provides a complete pipeline for single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Different functions were developed and provided: importing, quality control, filtering, transformation, linear and non linear dimensional reduction, clustering, feature marker selection, pathways and Gene Ontology analysis. 
The pipeline was tested and used to analyse GSE147326 dataset from GEO. To analyse other datasets one must change the imported data and change the parameters as needed. 

Description of the included files:
- scRNAseqPipelineFINAL.Rmd: Complete R code with all the implemented functions and an example of use.
- scRNAseqPipelineFINAL.html: Output of the example analysis performed.
- Appendix C. Function definition.docx: Description of the implemented functions for the scRNA-seq analysis.
