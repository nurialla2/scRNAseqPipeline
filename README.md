# scRNAseqPipeline

The following code provides a complete single-cell RNA sequencing analysis pipeline. Different functions were developed and provided: importing, quality control, fltering, transformation, linear and non linear dimensional reduction, clustering, feature marker selection, pathways and Gene Ontology analysis. 
The pipeline was tested and used to analyse GSE147326 dataset from GEO. To analyse other datasets one must change the imported data and change the parameters as needed.
